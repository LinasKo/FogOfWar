/*
 * The Fog of War is instantiated as an XZ plane that you should position
 * above your scene--for best effect, put it as close to your scene as
 * you can without having anything climb above the clouds (because that
 * looks dumb).  There is one place in this code where the Fog of War
 * has to adjust its behavior based on the height of your terrain: as
 * a default behavior it simply guesses Y=0, but you can search for the
 * word "ground" in this source file to find the relevant code and then
 * plug in any special code you want there to get better behavior.
 *
 * By itself, that Fog of War plane is just a bunch of clouds--prettyish
 * ones, true, but also boring.  To actually use it as a fog of war,
 * just instantiate Beacon objects on the map--and they'll create holes
 * in the clouds through which you can see.  (For an interesting effect,
 * you can also set the default cloud opacity lower and then use some
 * negative-strength beacons, which will draw clouds around them.)
 *
 * This model is designed to provide very low performance cost during
 * normal rendering: instead, a performance penalty is assessed at most
 * once per frame, and then only on frames when a beacon is changed.
 * Further, you can divide your beacons into Static and Dynamic ones,
 * so that changes to Dynamic beacons will not require recalculating the
 * Static beacons--and so the performance cost of the fog of war can
 * be further reduced.
